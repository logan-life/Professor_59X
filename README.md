This bot was initially developed during the inaugural hackathon event from the UPenn CIT59X student group by Logan Ayliffe and Abdulla AlBadi AlDhaheri. This bot uses python and tweepy to interact with the Twitter API. 

**Current features:**

The bot can tweet lines from a text file.

The bot can search for a particular hashtag and then interact with returned tweets, e.g. favorite / retweet / follow that user.
