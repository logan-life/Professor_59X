[Follow the Professor on Twitter here.](https://twitter.com/Professor_59X)

This bot was initially developed during the inaugural hackathon event from the UPenn CIT59X student group by Logan Ayliffe and Abdulla AlBadi AlDhaheri. This bot uses python and tweepy to interact with the Twitter API. The initial build was created using [this excellent tutorial from Digital Ocean.](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-twitterbot-with-python-3-and-the-tweepy-library)

**Current features:**

The bot can tweet lines from a text file.

The bot can search for a particular hashtag and then interact with returned tweets, e.g. favorite / retweet / follow that user.

The bot will tweet one picture per day from the images directory.

The bot can retweet any specified user. Currently retweets stuff from @PennEngineers.
